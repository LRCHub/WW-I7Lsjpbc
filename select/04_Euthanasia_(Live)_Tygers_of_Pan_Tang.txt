One, two, three, four, Euthanasia OK
Kill 'em off if you can
The gas is nice, but the needle's better,
Grandma.

Oh yeah Euthanasia OK,
All the way, Euthanasia.

Come on oldies it's your momentous day
To be murdered in this way.
You could only life for 30 years more,
So what reason have you got to stay.

Come into the chamber, it's really clean.
You won't catch any disease,
Oh Gran, we're not that mean.

Forgive us but you will have to pay,
Riding on our backs 60 years of the way.
Now close your eyes and hold your breath.
Open the gates, this is your final day.
