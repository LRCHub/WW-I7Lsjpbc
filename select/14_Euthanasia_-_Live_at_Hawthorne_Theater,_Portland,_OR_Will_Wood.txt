I was right there, while you fought tooth and nail
Gasping in the gas mask thrashing 'till you disappeared
Say you're not scared, that you know it's 'cause I cared and
Say you know I love you, and that hope was just not there

And I know, I know that I'm wrong
That when you're gone, you're gone and I can't bring you home
But I want, I want to believe
That you'll remember me when you're just memory

Roots in the ground or uploaded to the cloud or
Warm inside our hearts or as electrons in our head, nowhere now
Over the rainbow, can I stop by and say hello and
Sorry I would take it back if I could but I know

To love one from too far to call
Is not to love at all, to whom is it I talk?
But I want, I want to believe
That you can still hear me when you're just memory

Said "It's okay" and "It'll all be over soon"
I'd never let a bad thing happen to you
Now goodnight I love you

And every, everybody dies
Fighting for their lives, just trying to survive
Well now I know, I know why we say
That there's a better place that waits beyond the grave, oh, oh

And I know, I know it's not true
There's just no more you but as long as there's no proof
Then I choose, I choose to believe
That we'll meet in sweet dreams after you're put to sleep
